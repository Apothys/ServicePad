<h2> The Point </h2>
Where would we be without service? Without volunteers? ServcePad is a way to help establish the link between service groups an potential opportunities that exist within the community.

<h2> The Hopes and Dreams </h2>
The goal of this project is to design a Web-based system which can be used to promote community service activities by matching student/faculty/staff and teams to community service needs. There will be two types of users who can log into the system: students/faculty/staff with a CaseID and password and community partners who will need to create an account specifically for the system. It will provide a calendar of community service events for partners to post opportunities and for users to look for opportunities. It will allow organizations to request help from existing teams and individuals based on the users’ service interests. Furthermore. it will track the amount of service hours volunteers and teams have performed, as well as the number of community members served. These figures can be used by campus organizations to keep track of required hours.

<h2> The Whizzes and Bangs </h2>

The "<b>Whizzes</b>" offered to students/faculty/staff are:
<ul>
<li>Connecting with a campus organization that requires service hours (e.g. APO, social fraternity/sorority, Civic Engagement Scholars)</li>
<li>Create service teams independent of established campus organizations</li>
<li>Ability to search through available service opportunities</li>
<li>Create a list of service interests, so that partners can target users with specific areas of interest</li>
<li>A “Favorites” to temporarily hold service opportunities the user is interested in</li>
<li>Browse the system-wide calendar of opportunities for planning events around a certain date</li>
<li>Ability to search for statistics on a particular demographic</li> 
</ul>
The "<b>Bangs</b>" offered to community partners are:
<ul>
<li>Advertising of service opportunities offered by the partner to the users whose service interests overlap with the opportunities offered by the partner</li>
<li>Ability to request help from specific sets of users</li>
<li>Post opportunities to a system-wide calendar</li>
<li>Obtain a list of individuals, with contact information, who have committed themselves to the service opportunities offered by the partner
</ul>
